# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome! [ROCK PAPER SCISSORS](https://shankar2311.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissor/)

A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. As the computer player in Rock Paper Scissors choose randomly, the results of the game give a fairer result that playing with ones hands.

Users of this game will learn the rules of Rock Paper Scissors so they can apply it to decision making with others in their lives. This site will be targeted towards children and adults alike as a simple app to learn, practice and have fun with.
